	abstract = {Abstract. Identifying weather patterns that frequently lead to extreme weather events
is a crucial first step in understanding how they may vary under different
climate change scenarios. Here, we propose an automated method for
recognizing atmospheric rivers (ARs) in climate data using topological data
analysis and machine learning. The method provides useful information about
topological features (shape characteristics) and statistics of ARs. We
illustrate this method by applying it to outputs of version 5.1 of the
Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5.1) and the reanalysis product of
the second Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications
(MERRA-2). An advantage of the proposed method is that it is threshold-free
– there is no need to determine any threshold criteria for the detection
method – when the spatial resolution of the climate model changes. Hence,
this method may be useful in evaluating model biases in calculating AR
statistics. Further, the method can be applied to different climate scenarios
without tuning since it does not rely on threshold conditions. We show that
the method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model
and reanalysis output data.},

	abstract = {During the summer melt period, ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea ice as it melts, with important consequences for ice evolution and marine ecology. Due to the ice-albedo feedback, these melt ponds experience uneven heat absorption, and exhibit complex patterns, which has motivated the development of modelling and data analysis to understand their particular dynamics. We provide a multiscale shape analysis using tools from computational algebraic topology, simultaneously capturing convexity, proximity, integrity, and feature size complementing existing single-scale quantification. Of particular interest in modelling the ponds is a percolation threshold at which local pond structure begins merging into macroscopic features. This percolation threshold has previously been observed using fractal dimension techniques. The signed Euclidean distance transform (SEDT) is a topological encoding of heterogeneous shape in binary images, and has been previously applied to porous media for percolation as well as other material behaviours. Here we adapt the SEDT for Arctic melt pond data to give a rich characterization and computation of shape, quantifying overall melt pond development in several complementary ways, and from which classical percolation and dimension results can be extracted. This orientation-invariant topological approach distinguishes different dynamical network models of melt pond evolution of varying complexity.},

            Topological persistence is a powerful and general technique for characterizing the geometry and topology of data. Its theoretical foundations are over 15 years old and efficient computational algorithms are now available for the analysis of large digital images. We explain here how quantities derived from topological persistence relate to other measurements on porous materials such as grain and pore‐size distributions, connectivity numbers, and the critical radius of a percolating sphere. The connections between percolation and topological persistence are explored in detail using data obtained from micro‐CT images of spherical bead packings, unconsolidated sand packing, a variety of sandstones, and a limestone. We demonstrate how persistence information can be used to estimate the percolating sphere radius and to characterize the connectivity of the percolating cluster.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Topological data analysis (TDA) is a tool from data science and mathematics that is beginning to make waves in environmental science. In this work, we seek to provide an intuitive and understandable introduction to a tool from TDA that is particularly useful for the analysis of imagery, namely, persistent homology. We briefly discuss the theoretical background but focus primarily on understanding the output of this tool and discussing what information it can glean. To this end, we frame our discussion around a guiding example of classifying satellite images from the sugar, fish, flower, and gravel dataset produced for the study of mesoscale organization of clouds by Rasp et al. We demonstrate how persistent homology and its vectorization, persistence landscapes, can be used in a workflow with a simple machine learning algorithm to obtain good results, and we explore in detail how we can explain this behavior in terms of image-level features. One of the core strengths of persistent homology is how interpretable it can be, so throughout this paper we discuss not just the patterns we find but why those results are to be expected given what we know about the theory of persistent homology. Our goal is that readers of this paper will leave with a better understanding of TDA and persistent homology, will be able to identify problems and datasets of their own for which persistent homology could be helpful, and will gain an understanding of the results they obtain from applying the included GitHub example code.
            
              Significance Statement
              Information such as the geometric structure and texture of image data can greatly support the inference of the physical state of an observed Earth system, for example, in remote sensing to determine whether wildfires are active or to identify local climate zones. Persistent homology is a branch of topological data analysis that allows one to extract such information in an interpretable way—unlike black-box methods like deep neural networks. The purpose of this paper is to explain in an intuitive manner what persistent homology is and how researchers in environmental science can use it to create interpretable models. We demonstrate the approach to identify certain cloud patterns from satellite imagery and find that the resulting model is indeed interpretable.},

            It has long been suggested that the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation possesses what has come to be known as ‘weather regimes’, loosely categorised as regions of phase space with above-average density and/or extended persistence. Their existence and behaviour has been extensively studied in meteorology and climate science, due to their potential for drastically simplifying the complex and chaotic mid-latitude dynamics. Several well-known, simple non-linear dynamical systems have been used as toy-models of the atmosphere in order to understand and exemplify such regime behaviour. Nevertheless, no agreed-upon and clear-cut definition of a ‘regime’ exists in the literature, and unambiguously detecting their existence in the atmospheric circulation is stymied by the high dimensionality of the system. We argue here for an approach which equates the existence of regimes in a dynamical system with the existence of non-trivial topological structure of the system’s attractor. We show using persistent homology, an algorithmic tool in topological data analysis, that this approach is computationally tractable, practically informative, and identifies the relevant regime structure across a range of examples.},

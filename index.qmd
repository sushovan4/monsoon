## The Monsoon System

:::{.callout-note}
## Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
The seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the Indian Ocean, especially in the Arabian Sea, which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half

:::

- The biggest financial bet
- Only partly understood 
- Notoriously difficult to predict
- Affecting Indian flora and fauna, Indian economy, and agriculture
- The most acticipated weather phenomenon

## Nuisances of Climate Data
- high *dimensionality*
- *complexity* of realistic models
- presence of *noise*
- *missing* values
